Hello! I am a undergraduate student at the University of Florida. I plan to graduate with my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering in spring 2026.

My research interests are focused on robotic systems and adaptive control. I am particularly interested in exploring control approaches for multi-agent robotics. During my undergrad, I have worked on implementing first order herding algorightims on multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) at the UF Autonomy Park.
