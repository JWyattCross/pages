## Professional Experience

### Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division  
*Undergraduate Researcher* ‚Äî Gainesville, FL | Sep 2022 ‚Äì Present

- Demonstrated CFD-based hydrodynamic coefficient determination for state estimation of a UUV  
- Determined 39 of 43 total vehicle coefficients with the design of 18 different CFD simulations  
- Developed Python calculators to find coefficients from simulation and experimental data using a pseudoinverse to approximate a least squares solution  
- Documented simulations for future replication in OpenFOAM as the UUV configuration changes

### UF Nonlinear Controls and Robotics Group  
*Undergraduate Researcher* ‚Äî Gainesville, FL | Sep 2022 ‚Äì Present

- Implemented Lyapunov-based nonlinear herding algorithms utilizing deep neural networks while supporting 14 PhD candidates in their research and demonstrations  
- Designed and manufactured 40+ parts to integrate sensor payloads onto robots  
- Wrote ROS 2 Python packages to share and compare vehicle position between 8+ robots, allowing agents to be ‚Äúneutralized‚Äù to facilitate herding/swarming experiments  
- Built and deployed a remote emergency stop system using C++ and Arduino for 30+ robots
